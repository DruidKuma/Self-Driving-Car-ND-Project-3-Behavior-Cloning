Overview
---
This repository is my implementation of the Behavioral Cloning Project for Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program.

To manually look at autonomous driving using my trained model, please, start Udacity car simulator and execute

```sh
python drive.py model.json
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.
